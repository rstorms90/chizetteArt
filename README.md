Go to chizetteart.com

An artsite/portfolio for a painter who can create and edit posts. Users can filter by medium and buy prints of paintings.

I worked with a local artist who wanted to create a website that showcased her art as an online gallery.

On the front page we have a taste of what the site brings, a few art, jewelry, and photography. Each piece can be selected for a single view and all have a title, year, and medium.

I aimed to create a site that would look professional and would fit her style in order to show potential clients a digital portfolio.

Art pieces have price and button at bottom right hand corner integrating with the Printful API which lets you pick between variants (two different sized pieces) to have prints delivered to your address of choice.

Admin functionality also makes this a tool that can easily be used to upload new art and keep it organized as a visual archive.

I had a lot of fun balancing minimal design with fonts, a vibrant color palette, and animations that enhanced and evoked the art without distracting from it.
